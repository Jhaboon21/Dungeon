You are playing as a Treasure Hunter who heard of a tip that there was some valuable treasure in a dungeon nearby. 
You decide to explore this dungeon equiped with your trusty grappling gun. You find that there are traps, skeletons, and pitfalls throughout the dungeon. 

There are some puzzles that need to be solved and large pits of lava that must be swung across. In the last room, you find a chest with the treasure and an ominous skull that seems to be 
watching you. Upon picking up the chest, the dungeon shakes and appears to be collapsing and the skull grows in size and attempts to attack you. You hurrily try to escape with the treasure in hand. 

Leaving the dungeon causes the dungeon to calm down since the monsters cannot leave the dungeon. With treasure in hand, you decide to go home and look at the treasure and think of who you can give this to.
